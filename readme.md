# TaskBlocks README #

## What is it ##
TaskBlocks is simple application to help planning tasks. From version 0.5 it
supports also exporting tasks as Bugzilla bugs.

## Installation ##
You need Java JRE 5.0 or higher installed to run TaskBlocks. So, if you don't
have, install it first from http://java.sun.com. Mac OS X users
need to update their 10.4 system, which will install Java 5.0.

  * **Windows** download and run the taskblocks.exe file.

  * **Linux** and other-platformusers probably have to run the application from commandline like we have just described. Maybe double-clicking the taskblocks.jar file will work on some installations

  * **MacOS X** users can download the .dmg package and install it in obvious way - double-clicking the .dmg file and dragging the application icon to your Applications folder.

## Usage ##
The application interface should be so intuitive, that no further manual should
be needed ;-) If you find something not easilly understandable, you can write
to the autor.

## Building from source ##
To build the application from source, you need to download the source package,
and java compiler. The best way is to run ant. If you don't have it, just
compile the sources in usual way. There are no other libraries dependencies.
